    <p>Double, double toil and trouble;<br>
      Fire burn and caldron bubble.<br>
      Fillet of a fenny snake,<br>
      In the caldron boil and bake;<br>
      Eye of newt and toe of frog,<br>
      Wool of bat and tongue of dog,<br>
      Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,<br>
      Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,<br>
      For a charm of powerful trouble,<br>
      Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Double, double toil and trouble;<br>
      Fire burn and caldron bubble.<br>
      Cool it with a baboon's blood,<br>
      Then the charm is firm and good.</p>
