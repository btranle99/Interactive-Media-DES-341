        Double, double toil and trouble;<br>
        Fire burn and caldron bubble.<br>
        Fillet of a fenny snake,<br>
        In the caldron boil and bake;<br>
        Eye of newt and toe of frog,<br>
        Wool of bat and tongue of dog,<br>
        Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,<br>
        Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,<br>
        For a charm of powerful trouble,<br>
        Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.<br>
        <br><br>
        Double, double toil and trouble;<br>
        Fire burn and caldron bubble.<br>
        Cool it with a baboon's blood,<br>
        Then the charm is firm and good.<br>
