        Double, double toil and trouble;
        Fire burn and caldron bubble.
        Fillet of a fenny snake,
        In the caldron boil and bake;

        Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
        Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
        Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
        For a charm of powerful trouble,
        Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

        Fire burn and caldron bubble.
        Cool it with a baboon's blood,
        Then the charm is firm and good.
